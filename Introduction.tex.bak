ACCURATE localization is an essential part of many
wireless sensor network applications. Over the years,
many researchers have proposed many different solutions
for this problem (for example, [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8],
[9], [10], and [11]). In these techniques, there is a trade-off
between the accuracy of localization and the complexity of
implementation. For instance, least squares estimation
techniques (see [1]) require accurate radio frequency (RF)
channel parameters such as the radio path loss exponent.
Fingerprinting-based techniques (such as [8]) require
extensive preconfiguration studies that depend on the
features of the localization space. Other techniques require
specialized hardware (see [5]) or a complex configuration
procedure (see [11]). On the other extreme, really simple
techniques such as computing the centroid of nearby
beacons (see [7]) provide low accuracy. In this paper, we
present a novel sequence-based RF localization technique
that is lightweight, works with any hardware, and provides
accurate localization without requiring accurate channel
parameters or any preconfiguration.

At the heart of our proposed technique is the division of
a 2D localization space into distinct regions by the
perpendicular bisectors of lines joining pairs of reference
nodes (nodes with known locations). We show that each
distinct region formed in this manner can be uniquely
identified by a location sequence that represents the distance
ranks of reference nodes to that region. We present an
algorithm to construct the location sequence table that maps
all these feasible location sequences to the corresponding.

regions by using the locations of the reference nodes. This
table is used to localize an unknown node (that is, the node
whose location has to be determined) as follows.
The unknown node first determines its own location
sequence based on the measured strength of signals
between itself and the reference nodes. It then searches
through the location sequence table to determine the
¡°nearest¡± feasible sequence to its own measured sequence.
The centroid of the corresponding region is taken to be its
location.

In this paper, we focus only on acoustic source localization
in a wireless sensor network. Ideally, the measured
distance order of the reference nodes should be identical
to the distance order based on true euclidean distances.
However, this is not true in the real world, as the acoustic signals
are subjected to multipath fading and noise. These nonideal
effects corrupt the location sequence measured by the
unknown node. For n reference nodes in the localization
space, the possible number of combinations of distance rank
sequences is OennT. However, we prove in this paper that
the actual number of feasible location sequences is much
lower due to geometric constraints, that is, only Oen4T. The
lower dimensionality of the sequence table enables the
correction of errors in the measured sequence. This is one of
the reasons that our proposed sequence-based localization
(SBL) technique performs well despite channel errors.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: We
formally define location sequences in Section 2 and describe
the procedure of localization using them in Section 3. In the
same section, we derive the maximum number of feasible
location sequences, illustrate the construction of the location
sequence table, discuss the effect of RF channel nonidealities
on unknown node location sequences, and describe
metrics to measure the ¡°distance¡± between sequences. In
Section 4, we describe localization procedures for two
different application scenarios and show their robustness to
RF channel random errors through examples. In Section 5,
we present an exhaustive systematic performance study of our localization technique, in addition to conducting a
comparative study with state-of-the-art localization techniques.
We present the evaluation of our technique in real
mote experiments in Section 6 and discuss related work in
Section 7. We conclude and discuss our future work in
Section 8.
