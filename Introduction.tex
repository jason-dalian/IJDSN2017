\section{Introduction}

Acoustic source localization (ASL) plays an important role in a wide range of application scenarios, such
as speaker-location-aware audio capturing in videoconferencing \cite{guo2011localising}, shooter localization in battle field \cite{sallai2011acoustic}, and wild biological acoustic studies \cite{allen2008voxnet}. 
The traditional centralized microphone array-based solution to ASL exploit multiple synchronized microphones to simultaneously acquire multiple signals, which have some limitations with regards to distances between the microphones, and sensing range for the large-scale applications.
Wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs) can overcome these limitations. 
A WASN consists of a set of wireless microphone nodes that are spatially distributed over the environment, usually in an ad-hoc fashion. 
Due to the wireless communication capabilities, the array-size limitations disappear and the microphone nodes can physically cover a much larger area. 
ASL in WASN is increasingly becoming feasible due to recent advances in personal portable computing devices with the rapid deployment ability.

The acoustic source localization problem in sensor networks has been widely studied in the literature. 
In previous research on distributed acoustic source localization system, generally each node just has a single element. 
In the past few years, there has been a growing interest for acoustic nodes made of two or more synchronized microphones. 
Aarabi, \emph{et al.}~\cite{aarabi1900fusion} deployed 10 distributed dual-microphone arrays in a room and used their data to locate three speakers. 
Wu, \emph{et al.}~\cite{wu2012fusion} used three two-microphone arrays to locate two sound sources in a distributed way in which only the local DOA estimates are communicated among arrays.
Most of the distributed acoustic source localization systems are range-based localization, which built on top of distance or angle measurements among sensor nodes. 
These approaches can provide good accuracy performance, however, generally require costly hardware and have limited effective range due to energy constraints. 
The requirement of low cost and power prohibits many range-based methods for sensor node localization, especially for large-scale deployments. 
Yedavalli, \emph{et al.}~\cite{yedavalli2008sequence} proposed a Sequence-Based Localization (SBL) in wireless sensor networks. The heart of SBL is the division of a 2D localization space into distinct regions by the perpendicular bisectors of lines joining pairs of reference nodes (nodes with known locations).
Each distinct region formed in this manner can be uniquely identified by a location sequence that represents the distance ranks of reference nodes to that region. 
The unknown node first determines its own location sequence based on the measurement between itself and the reference nodes, then searches through the location sequence table to determine its location.

In this paper, we present a Linear Programming method to Sequence-Based Localization (LPSBL) by processing the node sequence. 
As a range-free approach, this design applies node sequences instead of direct distance
or TOA measurements for localization, and brings in the following two advantages: (i) node sequences features better
robustness to the measurement noise; (ii) node sequences significantly alleviates the accuracy requirement of network level time synchronization. 
Compared with earlier works on sequence-based localization in sensor
networks (e.g. SBL~\cite{yedavalli2008sequence}), the primary contribution
of this article is providing an effective and optimal approach
to solve the sequence-based localization problem for sensor networks. 
Without brute-force searching in SBL, the proposed LPSBL system formulates the
sensor node localization as an convex optimization problem
of finding a feasible solution to a system of multiple linear
inequalities, which is produced by the node sequences.
Then, linear programming (LP) can be applied to reliably
and efficiently deal with the convex optimization problem,
even in large-scale sensor networks. The proposed design
is evaluated with both test-bed experiments and extensive
simulations. Evaluation results show that the proposed
LPSBL system can provide improved node localization
accuracy.
