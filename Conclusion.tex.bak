In this paper, we have designed HammingLoc, a novel system that leverages ad-hoc smartphone array to achieve acoustic source localization using unreliable binary node sequences. The proposed design formulates the localization problem as searching in Hamming space by making use of the binary information from the smartphone array. Since our system runs on COTS smartphones and supports spontaneous setup, it has potential to enable a wide range of distributed acoustic sensing and microphone-array based signal processing systems. Besides the basic design, advanced HammingLoc and SNR-weighting HammingLoc are proposed for further enhancing system accuracy. Our system is verified and evaluated through analysis, extensive simulation as well as the test-bed experimentation. Our test results have shown that the proposed method can effectively implement aoustic source localization with ad-hoc smartphone array. A possible drawback of our method is the centralized computational structure. Our immediate next step to study the distributed localization method for ad-hoc smartphone array.
